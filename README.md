# 60DaysOfCode

A 60-day coding challenge dedicated to learning and revisiting core concepts such as Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA), Git, Operating Systems (OS), Database Management Systems (DBMS), Computer Networks (CN), and more.

## Why This Challenge?
I've set this challenge for myself because, as Haris Ali Khan (aka CodeWithHarry) once said, *"If you don't code for 3 days, you'll start forgetting things."* Initially, I took this as a joke, but I've realized how true it is. Due to a lack of consistency and practiceâ€”partly thanks to the ease of tools like AI and ChatGPTâ€”Iâ€™ve started forgetting things I've learned.

In my first two years of college, I gained a lot of knowledge and developed numerous projects such as:
- **Games:** Lost in Space, Flappy Bird, Time Reaction Game, Cooking Game, Hammer Mouse Game
- **Websites:** Smart Pour (an IoT project), and many more

Despite this, I now feel like everything I learned is slipping away. But no more whining, no more procrastinationâ€”it's time to get back on track!

## Let's Do This!
Itâ€™s high time to get serious and dive back into coding. 

Letâ€™s rock and roll! ðŸŽ¸ðŸ’»
